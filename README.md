# smart_proportional_stat_py
This is a python code file that allows you to figure out how many kinds of elements there are in a column of data and what's the proportion of each constituent; draw a pie-graph for the proportions automatically. It's supreme simple. You need only to give two arguments to make this function work: the path of the csv file you want to analyse in your computer, the sequence number of the column you want analyse in the csv file starting from 0. And then no matter how many and how many kinds of elements are there in the column, this program will draw pie-graph automatically. Very smart!
